# 🚀 42 Minishell 🚀
Ahoy, fellow code sailors! Welcome to my GitHub harbor, where the epic tales of the 42 Minishell project unfold. Dive into the coding seas, but remember, face the challenges alone before setting sail with my solutions, savvy?

## What's Minishell, Anyway?
Minishell is a project that invites you to a symphony of shell scripting. It's like conducting an orchestra of commands—a true coding performance! 🎻🔍

## Execute-it! 💻 

Just a few magic spells to summon your Minishell masterpiece:

- `make`: For a regular enchantment. Compile that code, and you're ready for the grand shell performance! This build isn't ready for use yet, please try SHITTY_TOKENIZER one.
- `make SHITTY_TOKENIZER`: Crafting this command will conjure up a highly functional test realm for our Minishell, brimming with enchantment and prowess.
- `make bonus`: Feeling adventurous? Add the bonus ingredients for an extra shell crescendo.
- `make clean`: Clear away the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a clean slate? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery using gdb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this mystical realm with these commands, and may your Minishell journey be legendary! 🌟🔮

## Cloning the Repository
Simply chant this command, and you're on board the ship:
